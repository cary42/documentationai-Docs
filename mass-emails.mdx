</Callout>

## Understand the Mass Emails list

The Mass Emails list helps you review past emails, manage drafts, and track performance.

Key parts of the list:

- **Columns**

  - **Subject** – The email title and main link to open or edit the email.

  - **Status** – One of:

    - **Draft** – Not sent yet; still editable.

    - **Scheduled** – Set to send at a future date/time.

    - **Sent** – Fully sent to all selected recipients.

    - **Auto-Sending** – Ongoing email that automatically sends to new users who match its recipient filters.

  - **Stats** – At-a-glance performance:

    - **Sent** – Number of messages sent.

    - **Opened** – Number of unique opens.

    - **Open rate** – Percentage of sent emails that were opened.

  - **Date Created** – When the email was first created.

  - **Date Sent** – When the email actually went out (for Sent emails).

- **Filters**

  - **Active / Archived** – Switch between active emails and archived history.

  - Quick filters: **All, Sent, Scheduled, Drafts, Auto-Sending** for fast status-based views.

- **Common actions**

  - **Open / Edit** – Click the **Subject** to open the email composer and edit settings, recipients, or content.

  - **Copy** – Duplicate an existing email to reuse content and recipient filters.

  - **Archive / Unarchive** – Hide older emails from the Active view without deleting their stats or logs.

Use these tools to keep your communication organized and to quickly find past campaigns.

## Create and send a new mass email

Use these steps when you want to send a new communication to a group of families or users.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a new email" icon="plus" title-type="p">
    - From **Communication → Mass Emails**, click **New Email**.

    - The email composer opens on the **Settings** tab with a new Draft.

    - The status stays as **Draft** until you send now or schedule it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete the Settings tab" icon="settings" title-type="p">
    - Fill in sender details, subject, and content.

    - Choose whether this is a marketing email and set when it should send.

    - Optionally add attachments such as PDFs or images.

    You can find details on each field in the [Email settings reference](#email-settings-reference) below.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose recipients" icon="users" title-type="p">
    - Go to the **Recipients** tab.

    - Build or select filters to target the right families or users.

    - Confirm the **recipient count** before sending.

    If you skip this step, Campium warns you that no recipients are selected.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and preview your email" icon="play-circle" title-type="p">
    - On the **Settings** tab, use **Send Test Email** to send a copy to yourself or a colleague.

    - Use **Preview Email** to see how the email will look in a typical inbox.

    Confirm that links, merge fields, and formatting look correct before sending to families.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send or schedule the email" icon="rocket" title-type="p">
    - If you want to send immediately, leave **When To Send** blank or set it to the current time, then click **Send Now**.

    - If you want to send later, set **When To Send** to your future date/time. The email shows as **Scheduled** until it is sent.

    - For emails using dynamic filters, you may see **Send To Updated Recipients** when filters or recipients change.

    After sending, the email moves to **Sent** (or continues as **Auto-Sending** if you enabled auto-send).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="alert" collapsed="false">
  Before you send, double-check both the **recipient count** and the **When To Send** time. Mass emails cannot be unsent once they have gone out.
</Callout>

## Composer tabs: Settings, Recipients, Logs

Use the tabs at the top of the composer to move between content, audience, and history.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Settings" icon="settings">
    The **Settings** tab controls the content, sender information, timing, and core email options.

    Typical tasks on this tab:

    - Set the **From** name and address.

    - Enter the **Subject** line.

    - Pick a **Template** and edit the message body.

    - Mark the email as a **Marketing Email** (to include an unsubscribe link).

    - Configure **When To Send**, test sends, and previews.

    - Add **Attachments** if needed.

    See [Email settings reference](#email-settings-reference) for field-by-field details.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Recipients" icon="users">
    The **Recipients** tab defines who will receive the email.

    On this tab you can:

    - Use the **dynamic filter builder** to target specific groups (by session, status, payment state, and other criteria).

    - Select from **saved filters** you use frequently.

    - Choose to **display all users** when you want to send broadly.

    - View the **estimated recipient count** and click **View Recipients** to review the list in more detail.

    Campium shows a warning if you have not set any recipients so you do not accidentally schedule or send an email to zero people.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Logs" icon="bar-chart">
    The **Logs** tab shows delivery and engagement details after you send.

    Information on this tab typically includes:

    - Per-recipient **sent** timestamps.

    - **Opened** events for each recipient.

    - High-level stats such as **Sent**, **Opened**, and **Time Sent**.

    For some emails, you may also see a **Resend to non-openers** option, which lets you follow up only with families who did not open the first message.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Email settings reference

Use these field descriptions as a quick reference while you work on the **Settings** tab.

### From (required)

Display name and email address that appear to recipients as the sender. Use a recognizable camp address so families trust and recognize your messages.

### Subject (required)

The email subject line shown in recipients' inboxes. Keep it clear and specific, for example, `Session 2: Bus Schedule and Packing List`.

### Template (optional)

Optional layout or content template to start from. Choose a template to reuse a standard header, footer, or structure, then edit the message body as needed.

### Marketing Email (optional)

Set to **Yes** for promotional or marketing-style emails. When you mark an email as marketing, Campium adds an unsubscribe link for compliance and recipient preferences.

<Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
  Use **Marketing Email = Yes** for newsletters, promotions, or announcements families might want to opt out of. Use **No** for strictly operational notices where unsubscribes are not appropriate.
</Callout>

### When To Send (optional)

Select a date and time to schedule the email. If you leave this blank or set it to now, the email sends immediately when you click **Send Now**. If you pick a future time, the email shows as **Scheduled** until that time.

### Auto-send Emails To New Matching Recipients (optional)

When set to **Yes**, Campium continues sending this email automatically to any new users who match the recipient filters in the future. The email status changes to **Auto-Sending** and remains active until you disable or archive it.

<Callout kind="alert" collapsed="false">
  If you enable **Auto-send Emails To New Matching Recipients**, treat this email like an ongoing campaign. Review the filters carefully so new families do not receive outdated content.
</Callout>

### Attachments (optional)

Upload files to include with your email, such as JPG or PNG images, PDF documents, or QuickTime videos. Each file can be up to **10MB**, and you can upload multiple files per email.

## Work with recipients and filters

The **Recipients** tab is where you decide who receives your message.

- **Dynamic filter builder**

  - Add one or more conditions (for example, enrolled in a session, outstanding balance, camper age).

  - Combine filters to narrow down to exactly the group you need.

  - Save filters you use frequently so you can apply them quickly to future emails.

- **Saved filters**

  - Apply previously saved audience definitions in a single click.

  - Useful for regular sends like "All current-season families" or "Staff members."

- **Show all users**

  - Use the option to **display all users** when you truly mean to send camp-wide.

  - Combine with additional filters if you start broad and then refine.

- **Recipient count and list**

  - Review the **record count** displayed for your current filters.

  - Click **View Recipients** to see the list of individual recipients when you need to verify who will receive the email.

<Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
  Always check the **recipient count** and, when sending to a sensitive group, use **View Recipients** to spot-check the list before sending.
</Callout>

Campium shows a **warning** on the Recipients tab if no recipients are set. Resolve this warning before you test, schedule, or send the email.

## Sending, testing, and resending

Use these actions in the composer to control how and when your email goes out.

### Send Test Email

- From the **Settings** tab, click **Send Test Email**.

- Enter one or more test addresses (often your own or staff).

- Review formatting, links, and merge fields in a real inbox before sending to families.

### Preview Email

- Click **Preview Email** to see how the email looks on screen.

- Use this preview to catch spacing issues, long subject lines, or missing content.

### Send Now vs scheduled send

- **Send Now**

  - Use when you are ready to send immediately.

  - Works best when **When To Send** is blank or set to the current time.

  - After you confirm, the email status becomes **Sent** and stats begin to update as recipients open it.

- **Scheduled**

  - Set **When To Send** to a future date and time.

  - The email status shows as **Scheduled** on the list page.

  - Campium automatically sends the email at the scheduled time; you can usually edit or cancel it while it is still in Scheduled status.

### Resend to non-openers

For some emails, Campium offers a **Resend to non-openers** option after the initial send:

- Available when enough data is present to identify who did not open the original email.

- Sends a follow-up only to recipients who did not open the first message.

- Useful for reminders about forms, payments, or upcoming dates.

Use the **Logs** tab and **Stats** on the list page to decide whether a resend is necessary.

## Attachments best practices

Attachments help you share detailed information such as schedules, forms, or flyers.

Keep in mind:

- Supported file types:

  - Images such as JPG or PNG for visual materials.

  - PDFs for documents, forms, and handouts.

  - QuickTime videos for short clips.

- Size limit:

  - Each attachment can be up to **10MB**.

  - If you have multiple large files, consider linking to a shared folder or website instead of attaching everything.

Check that attachments open correctly from your **Send Test Email** before you send to families.

## After sending: stats and logs

Once your email is sent (or auto-sending), monitor performance from the list and the **Logs** tab.

- On the **Mass Emails list**, review:

  - **Sent** count, **Opened** count, and **Open rate**.

  - **Status** to confirm the email is Sent, Scheduled, Draft, or Auto-Sending.

- On the **Logs** tab, drill into:

  - Individual recipients and whether their email was sent and opened.

  - **Time Sent** to confirm when the system delivered the message.

Use these insights to refine subjects, sending times, and audiences for future emails.
