## Overview

Use the Family Payment Plans Report for the selected season to see which families are on payment plans, their current balances, primary contact details, payment methods, and any profile fields you choose to display.

Finance admins typically use this report to confirm families are correctly assigned to plans, spot balances that need follow-up, and export contact details for outreach.

<Callout kind="info">

The report title includes the active season name, such as `Family Payment Plans Report for Summer 2025` or `Family Payment Plans Report for Fall 2025`.

## Configure profile field display columns

Use **Profile Fields Display Settings** to add custom profile information as columns in the report so you can see relevant context (for example, grade, campus, or internal flags) alongside each family.

<Steps>

<Step title="Open Profile Fields Display Settings" icon="settings">

- Locate the **Profile Fields Display Settings** section near the top of the report.
- Click **Display Columns** to open the configuration for which profile fields should appear as columns.

Success signal: A settings area or dialog appears listing available profile fields with options to enable them for display.

</Step>

<Step title="Choose which profile fields to display" icon="edit">

- In the profile field list, select the fields you want to appear as columns in the report.
- Each selected field will become a dynamic column using its display name (such as `Campus`, `Grade`, or `Billing Status`).

Success signal: The selected fields are marked as active or checked in the settings area.

</Step>

<Step title="Save profile field settings" icon="check-circle">

- Click **Save Profile Field Settings** to apply your changes.
- Wait for the report to reload with the new columns visible.

Success signal: The table now shows additional columns with the profile field display names you selected. Your selections persist when you revisit the report.

</Step>

</Steps>

### Profile display settings options

Each configurable part of the **Profile Fields Display Settings** area controls which custom data appears in the report.

#### Profile Fields Display Settings

Use this configuration area to show or hide dynamic profile field columns in the report. Tailor the report to the information you care about most.

#### Display Columns

Use this button to open the profile field display configuration. Click it to choose which profile fields should appear as additional columns in the table.

#### Save Profile Field Settings

Use this button to save your selected profile fields and refresh the report. The report then displays one column per selected field, using each field's display name as the column header.

#### Profile field selection

Review the list of available profile fields that you can enable as columns. For each selected field, the report adds a dynamic column with the profile field's display name, such as `Team`, `Dorm`, or `Discount Code`.

<Callout kind="info">

Use profile field columns to avoid exporting to a spreadsheet for basic context. For deeper analysis or cross-report comparisons, consider using a custom report with the same profile fields.

</Callout>

## Report columns

The main table shows one row per family with a payment plan in the selected season, plus any dynamic profile field columns you enabled.

### Standard columns

These columns always appear in the report.

#### Name

Family name shown on the account, typically the primary billing name. Use this to identify the family in other financial reports.

#### Users

Number of users linked to the family account. This usually reflects enrolled campers or participants associated with the family.

#### Plan Name

Name of the assigned payment plan for the family. This helps you confirm each family is on the correct plan and compare across different plan types.

#### Balance

Current outstanding balance for the family within the selected season and payment plan. Finance admins typically sort or filter by this column to identify high balances for follow-up.

#### Phone

Primary phone number for the family or guardian contact. Use this for quick outreach when you need to discuss payment arrangements.

#### Guardian 1 Email

Email address for the first guardian contact on the account. This is the main email most communications and billing notices use.

#### Guardian 2 Email

Email address for the second guardian contact, if available. Use this for copied communications or when Guardian 1 is unresponsive.

#### Method

Saved payment method associated with the family's payment plan, such as card or bank account. Use this to verify whether families have a valid method on file for scheduled payments.

### Dynamic profile field columns

When you enable profile fields in **Profile Fields Display Settings**, the report adds one column for each selected field.

#### Dynamic profile field columns

Additional columns that appear when you enable profile fields. Each column header uses the profile field's display name, such as `Grade`, `Campus`, `Program Type`, or any other field configured in your system. The values in these columns show the saved profile information for each family.

<Callout kind="info">

Dynamic profile field columns are read-only in this report. Update the underlying profile data in the family's record if values are incorrect, then rerun the report to see the changes.

</Callout>

## Empty state and no-results behavior

When no families match the selected filters, the report shows a clear message instead of a blank table.

### Empty state message

The report shows the message `There are currently no payments scheduled.` when there are no matching payment plan records for the selected season and payment plan.

Typical situations where you might see this message include:

- The season is new and no families have been assigned to payment plans yet.
- You selected a payment plan that no families are currently using.
- Filters were changed from a previously populated state and no records match the new combination.

<Callout kind="alert">

If you expect families to appear but see `There are currently no payments scheduled.`, double-check the season and payment plan selections, then confirm that payment plans are actually assigned in family accounts.

</Callout>

## Practical uses and next steps

Finance admins often pair the Family Payment Plans Report with other financial reports to reconcile revenue and monitor collections.

After reviewing this report, you might:

- Export the data (if export options are available) for offline analysis or mail merge.
- Use the **Phone**, **Guardian 1 Email**, and **Guardian 2 Email** columns to contact families behind on payments.
- Adjust **Profile Fields Display Settings** to surface information like discount codes, campus, or internal risk flags.
