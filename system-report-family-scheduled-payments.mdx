## Overview

Use the Family Scheduled Payments report to review upcoming scheduled payments for families in a given season, identify gaps or issues, and trigger payment notification emails directly from the report.

The page title in the UI appears as `Family Scheduled Payments for {season}`, where the season selector controls which season's schedules you review.

<Callout kind="info">
  The report focuses on **scheduled** activity for a single season, not historical payments already completed.
</Callout>

## Open the Family Scheduled Payments report

Access the report from your Campium admin tools.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the season" icon="calendar" title-type="h3">
    Use the season selector at the top of the page to choose the season you want to review.

    The page title updates to `Family Scheduled Payments for {season}` to confirm which season is currently in view.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the report page" icon="folder" title-type="h3">
    Go to the **Reports** area, then choose **System** and select the **Family Scheduled Payments** report.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Filters

Filters at the top of the report help you narrow which families and schedules appear before you review balances and send notifications.

Use the **Apply Filters** button after any change to update the results.

### Payment Type

Filter families by how their scheduled payments are set up and whether a payment method is on file.

Filter the list based on payment method status. Options:

- **All**: Show all families in the season, regardless of payment method.
- **Credit Card**: Show families with a credit card as their scheduled payment method.
- **ACH**: Show families using ACH for scheduled payments.
- **No Account on File**: Show families that do not have a payment account on file.

### Issues

Limit the report to families with potential problems in their schedule, or view only clean plans.

Filter families based on whether the system has flagged any issues:

- **All Families**: Show all families, whether or not they have issues.
- **With Issues**: Show only families that have at least one issue flagged in the Issues column.
- **No Issues**: Show only families whose schedules do not have any flagged issues.

### Records per page

Control how many rows appear at once in the report table.

Set the maximum number of family rows displayed on each page of results. Options:

- **100**
- **500**
- **1,000**
- **2,000**

Use higher values when exporting or scanning many families, and lower values for quicker page loads and easier scrolling.

### Payment Plan

Filter by families’ assigned payment plan within the selected season.

Limit the report to a specific payment plan or show all families:

- **All Plans**: Include all payment plans for the season.
- **No Plan Assigned** (if available): Show families in the season that do not have any payment plan assigned.
- **Individual plans**: Additional options list each configured payment plan, allowing you to review one plan at a time.

### Apply Filters button

After setting your filter options, apply them to refresh the table.

Run the report with the current filter selections. The table below updates to show only families that match your chosen Payment Type, Issues, Records per page, and Payment Plan settings.

## Table columns

The main report table summarizes key information about each family’s scheduled payments, any gaps, and issues.

Use the column details below as a reference when reviewing results or when deciding which families need follow-up.

### Actions

Shows the **mail icon** action for each family with tooltip `Send Email`. Click the icon to open the **Send Payment Notification** window and send an email about the family’s scheduled payments.

### Family

Displays the family name or household identifier that the payment plan and scheduled payments belong to.

### Payment Plan

Shows the payment plan currently assigned to the family for the selected season. This matches the plan options in the Payment Plan filter.

### Balance

Shows the family’s outstanding balance for the season. Use this to understand how much remains to be collected.

### Scheduled

Shows the total amount currently scheduled in future payments for the family. Compare this with Balance to see whether scheduled payments will fully cover what is owed.

### Gap

Shows the difference between the Balance and the Scheduled amount. A non‑zero gap suggests that scheduled payments may not fully cover the family’s remaining balance.

### Next Payment

Lists the date and amount of the next scheduled payment for the family. Use this to confirm when the next charge is expected.

### Payment Methods

Summarizes the payment methods associated with the family’s scheduled payments, such as whether they use credit card, ACH, or have no account on file.

### Upcoming Schedule

Provides a brief view of the upcoming scheduled payments for the family, including timing or installments, so you can quickly see how the remaining balance is planned.

### Issues

Lists any issues the system has detected for the family’s scheduled payments. Entries here align with the **Issues** filter and help you prioritize families that need attention.

<Callout kind="alert">
  Focus on families with a non‑zero **Gap** or entries in the **Issues** column when troubleshooting. These families are most likely to have under‑scheduled payments or configuration problems.
</Callout>

## Send payment notifications from the report

Use the Actions column to send targeted payment notification emails to families based on what you see in the report.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Send Payment Notification window" icon="mail" title-type="h3">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review previous emails sent" icon="info" title-type="h3">
    Inside the window, find the **Previous Emails Sent** section.

    Use this area to check whether you have already contacted the family about their scheduled payments and when those messages were sent. Use the **View** links (if shown) to review prior email details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview the email content" icon="monitor" title-type="h3">
    Scroll to the **Email Preview:** section inside the window.

    Confirm that the email content matches what you expect to send about the family’s scheduled payments, gaps, or issues.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send or cancel the notification" icon="check-circle" title-type="h3">
    At the bottom of the window, choose one of the available buttons:

    - **Send Email**: Send the payment notification to the family using the previewed content.
    - **Cancel**: Close the window without sending a new email.

    After you send, the new message appears in **Previous Emails Sent** the next time you open the window for that family.
