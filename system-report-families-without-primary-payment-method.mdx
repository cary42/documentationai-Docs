## Purpose of this report

Use the **Families Without Primary Payment Method** report to find families that do not have a primary payment method on file for a given season, along with how many active registrations and how much balance each family has outstanding.

This report helps you prioritize outreach to families who still need to add a payment method, especially when they have active registrations and unpaid balances.

<Callout kind="info">

The UI title of the report includes the selected season, for example: `Families Without Primary Payment Method - Summer 2025`.

</Callout>

## Run the report

Use this workflow whenever you want a current list of families missing a primary payment method.

<Steps>

<Step title="Open the report" icon="folder">

- From the admin portal, go to **Reports**.
- In the **System** section, open **Families Without Primary Payment Method**.
- Confirm the page title shows **Families Without Primary Payment Method - [selected season]**.

When the page loads successfully, you see a **Filters** card at the top and a results table with columns for **Primary Contact**, **Email**, **Active Registrations**, and **Balance**.

</Step>

<Step title="Set your filters" icon="settings">

- In the **Filters** card, locate the **Season** selector.
- Choose the season you want to review (for example, the current camp season).
- Apply or refresh the report so the table reflects your selected season.

After applying the filter, the results table updates and the page title includes the chosen season.

</Step>

<Step title="Review results and plan follow-up" icon="bar-chart">

- Scan the **Balance** column to spot higher dollar amounts.
- Check **Active Registrations** to see how many current registrations each family has.
- Click a **Primary Contact** name to open the profile and review full account details.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Filters

The Filters card appears at the top of the report and controls which families are included.

### Season

Season context for the report. The results only include families with activity in the selected season and without a primary payment method on file. The same family may appear or disappear when you switch seasons.

<Callout kind="tip">

If you manage multiple seasons at once, run this report separately for each active season so you do not miss families who only have registrations in a specific season.

</Callout>

## Columns in the results table

Each row in the report represents one family account without a primary payment method defined for the selected season.

### Primary Contact

Name of the primary contact for the family account. This value links to the family profile and opens the profile view for quick access to account details.

<Callout kind="info">

Use the Primary Contact link to confirm whether the family has any other payment methods on file, recent payments, or special notes before you reach out.

</Callout>

### Email

Primary email address associated with the family account. Use this to send reminders about adding a primary payment method or to follow up on outstanding balances.

### Active Registrations

Number of current, active registrations for this family in the selected season. Higher numbers indicate families whose participation depends more heavily on successful billing.

### Balance

Outstanding balance for the family account, shown as a currency value. This helps you judge financial impact when prioritizing which families to contact first.

<Callout kind="alert">

Families with **Active Registrations** greater than zero and a high **Balance** but no primary payment method are at higher risk for missed payments. Prioritize these accounts for outreach.

</Callout>

## Totals and footer

The footer of the report summarizes how many families match your filters and the total outstanding balance among them.

### Total families

Displays as `Total: [X] familie(s)` and counts how many family accounts appear in the table for the selected season.

### Total balance

Shows the combined outstanding balance across all families in the report. Use this to understand the overall exposure for families missing a primary payment method.

## Follow-up runbook

This is a common workflow admins use after running the report.

<Steps>

<Step title="Prioritize families" icon="bar-chart">

- Sort by **Balance** (descending) and then by **Active Registrations**.
- Flag or note the top tier of families with both high balances and multiple registrations.
- Decide on a threshold (for example, balance above a certain amount) for proactive outreach.

</Step>

<Step title="Review individual accounts" icon="book-open">

- Click each **Primary Contact** name to open the profile.
- Confirm recent payment activity, notes, or alternate arrangements.
- Check whether the family already started adding a payment method but did not complete setup.

</Step>

<Step title="Contact families and track resolution" icon="mail">

- Use the **Email** address to send reminders or payment method instructions.
- Add internal notes in the profile on the outcome of each contact.
- Re-run the **Families Without Primary Payment Method** report periodically to confirm the list is shrinking as families add payment methods.
