description: Identify families without scheduled payments for a selected season, understand each column in the Scheduled Payments - Missing report, and interpret no-data results.

## Purpose of the Scheduled Payments - Missing report

Use the **Scheduled Payments - Missing** report to find families that do not have any scheduled payments set up for a given season. This helps you close gaps in payment plans before balances become overdue.

When a family appears on this report, at least one student tied to that family has a balance for the selected season and no active scheduled payments covering that balance.

<Callout kind="info">

Run this report regularly during enrollment and early in the season to catch families who still need to set up scheduled payments.

## How to open and run the report

Access the report from the system menu and choose the season you want to review.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Open the Scheduled Payments - Missing report" icon="folder">

  - Go to the **Reports** area in your Campium Money admin portal.
  - Select **System**.
  - Open the **Scheduled Payments - Missing** report.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select season or All Seasons" icon="settings">

  - Use the **Season** selector at the top of the page.
  - Choose a specific season (for example, **2024–2025**) or select **All Seasons**.
  - The page title updates to show **Scheduled Payments - Missing for** the season name or **Scheduled Payments - Missing for All Seasons** so you always know which data you are viewing.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the results" icon="bar-chart">

  - After you select a season, the system loads all families missing scheduled payments into the table.
  - Scan the **Balance** and **Primary Payment** columns first to gauge urgency and how each family should be contacted.
  - Export or print the page if you want to share it with your finance or billing team.

  </Step>

</Steps>

When the report loads successfully with matching criteria, you see a table of families or a no-data message if everyone is covered.

## When a family appears on this report

A family appears on the **Scheduled Payments - Missing** report when:

- The family has an outstanding **Balance** for the selected season, and  
- The family does not have scheduled payments configured to pay down that balance.

Families that have fully configured scheduled payments for their seasonal charges do not appear here.

<Callout kind="alert">

If a family appears on this report but you know they are paying by another method (for example, check or cash), document their arrangement in your internal notes. The report only tracks **scheduled** electronic payments, not ad-hoc or offline payments.

</Callout>

Use this report as a worklist to:

- Reach out to guardians who still need to set up a payment plan  
- Confirm payment preferences (scheduled payments versus one-time or offline payments)  
- Reduce surprises at season start by making sure each family has a clear plan for their outstanding balance  

## Table columns and data

The report displays one row per family that is missing scheduled payments, plus a total in the footer.

<Callout kind="info">

All column labels in this section match the report UI exactly, including capitalization and spacing.

</Callout>

### Guardian 1

Primary guardian name for the family, as stored in the family profile. Use this to identify who is financially responsible and to personalize outreach.

### Phone

Primary phone number for Guardian 1. Call this number to discuss setting up scheduled payments or to confirm an alternate payment arrangement.

### Guardian 1 Email

Email address for Guardian 1. Use this for sending reminders, payment plan offers, or direct links to the payment portal.

### Primary Payment

Current default payment method on file for the family, such as a card or bank account. If this field is empty or out of date, help the guardian add or update a valid method before you create scheduled payments.

### User Type

Classification of the family or account, based on your Campium Money configuration. Use this to filter or prioritize follow-up (for example, different handling for staff families versus standard families).

### Balance

Outstanding amount owed by the family for the selected season or across all seasons. Larger balances indicate higher priority for setting up scheduled payments.

The **Balance** column also includes a footer row with a **total**:

- The footer total shows the sum of the **Balance** column for all families in the report.  
- Use the total to understand the overall financial exposure from families without scheduled payments.

## No-data message and what it means

If no families meet the criteria, the system shows this message instead of the table:

> **There are currently no families missing scheduled payments.**

This means that, for the selected season or all seasons, every family with a balance has scheduled payments set up, or no one has an outstanding balance.

When you see this message, you do not need to take further action for scheduled payments for that season.

## Using the report to take action

Turn the report results into a concrete follow-up plan.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Prioritize by balance and contactability" icon="bar-chart">

  - Sort or visually scan for higher **Balance** amounts first.
  - Confirm that **Guardian 1**, **Phone**, and **Guardian 1 Email** fields look complete so you know how to reach each family.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Reach out to guardians" icon="users">

  - Use **Phone** for urgent or high-balance families to discuss payment options live.
  - Use **Guardian 1 Email** to send payment-plan instructions or links for lower-balance or non-urgent cases.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up or confirm payment plans" icon="check-circle">

  - Work with each family to configure scheduled payments that cover their **Balance**.
  - After scheduled payments are active and saved in Campium Money, the family should drop off the **Scheduled Payments - Missing** report the next time you refresh it.
