## What settings do for your camp

Settings control how Campium behaves for your families, staff, and finance team. They bring together your camp details, schedules, communication tools, and reporting options so everything stays consistent and organized.

When you dial in your settings, you avoid last‑minute changes, reduce manual work, and give families a smoother experience when they log in, register, and pay.

<Callout kind="info">

Review your Settings at the start of each season and whenever your policies, pricing, or communication style changes. A quick review now prevents confusion later.

    From the left sidebar, click **Admin**.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to Site Settings" icon="settings" titleType="p">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm you are in the right place" icon="check-circle" titleType="p">

  </Step>
</Steps>

When you are finished making changes, look for a **Save** or **Update** button in each section so your changes apply to your live site.

## Business Info and Logo

Your basic business details and branding live in the **Business Info & Logo** section. This is where you set the name, contact details, and logo families see across emails and portals.

- Set your official camp name, address, phone number, and main contact email.
- Upload your camp logo so it appears on family portals and communication.
- Make sure families always see up‑to‑date contact details if they need help.

For step‑by‑step details, see the dedicated guide: [Business Info & Logo](/business-info-and-logo).

## Main settings areas

The rest of Settings is organized into areas that match the way you run camp: seasons, security, communication, reports, and forms. Expand each area below to learn what it covers.

<ExpandableGroup>

  <Expandable title="Seasons & Sessions (your camp schedule)" default-open="true">

  Use **Seasons & Sessions** to organize when your programs run and how families register.

  - Set up each **season** (for example, Summer, Winter, School Year).
  - Create **sessions** within a season (for example, Week 1 Overnight, Week 2 Day Camp).
  - Control which seasons and sessions families can see and sign up for.

  A clear Seasons & Sessions setup keeps your registration pages clean and makes it easier to report on attendance and revenue later. Learn more in [Seasons & Sessions](/seasons-and-sessions).

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Authentication (sign-in and account security)" default-open="false">

  **Authentication** settings control how families and staff sign in to Campium and how you protect their accounts.

  - Decide how strict password rules should be.
  - Set how often people need to log in again on shared devices.
  - Turn on options that make it harder for someone to access an account they should not see.

  Strong sign‑in settings reduce the chance of unauthorized access and help you meet your organization’s privacy expectations. For more detail, see [Authentication](/authentication).

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Communications (Mass Emails, SMS, messaging, news, and app chat)" default-open="false">

  Communications settings decide how you reach families and staff from inside Campium.

  - **Mass Emails**: Configure who emails come from and which email types you plan to send at scale, such as announcements or reminders. See [Mass Emails](/mass-emails).
  - **SMS**: Turn on text messaging and manage how you send short alerts, reminders, and updates. See [SMS](/sms).
  - **One-way Messaging**: Set up alerts where you send messages, but families do not reply, such as emergency notifications. See [One-way Messaging](/one-way-messaging).
  - **Portal News**: Manage the news items families see when they log into their portal, such as upcoming events or policy changes. See [Portal News](/portal-news).
  - **Push Notifications**: Decide what types of notifications appear on families’ devices when they use the app. See [Push Notifications](/push-notifications).
  - **App Chat**: Control how chat works between your team and families inside the Campium app. See [App Chat](/app-chat).

  Together, these tools help you reach the right people at the right time, using the channels they prefer.

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Reports (financial, system, and custom views)" default-open="false">

  Report settings shape how you track money, attendance, and important follow‑up tasks.

  - **Financial reports**: Summarize payments and revenue so your finance team can match Campium to your bank records and accounting tools. Common examples include [Deposit Summary](/deposit-summary) and [Revenue Summary](/revenue-summary).
  - **System reports**: Use scheduled‑payment and payment‑status reports to stay ahead of issues like upcoming charges, expired cards, or missing payment methods. Examples include:
    - [Scheduled Payments Report](/system-report-scheduled-payments)
    - [Family Scheduled Payments report](/system-report-family-scheduled-payments)
    - [Scheduled Payments - Missing report](/system-report-scheduled-payments-missing)
    - [Scheduled Payment Email Log](/system-report-scheduled-payment-email-log)
    - [Expired CC Report](/system-report-expired-cc-report)
    - [Family Payment Plans Report](/system-report-payment-plans)
    - [Payment Method Updates – Families with Failed Payments](/system-report-payment-method-updates-families-with-failed-payments)
    - [Families Without Primary Payment Method report](/system-report-families-without-primary-payment-method)
  - **Custom Reports**: Build and save your own report layouts so you can quickly answer questions your team asks often, like “Which families still need to complete medical forms?” See [Custom Reports](/custom-reports).

  Thoughtful report settings make it easier to answer money and attendance questions without exporting data or doing manual counts.

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="Forms (registration and information collection)" default-open="false">

  **Forms** settings control the information you collect from families before and during camp.

  - Create and update registration forms so families give you what you need to enroll campers.
  - Add health, waiver, and policy agreement questions so your staff has the right information on file.
  - Decide which forms are required before a camper is considered fully registered.

  A clear Forms setup keeps your staff prepared, reduces last‑minute paperwork at check‑in, and helps you meet your safety and compliance requirements. Learn more in [Forms](/forms).

## Tips for managing settings

<Callout kind="tip">

- **Review once per season**: Before opening registration for a new season, confirm your Seasons & Sessions, pricing, and Forms match your current plans.
- **Test as a family**: After changes, log in as a test family to see what the portal, emails, and texts look like from their side.
- **Limit who can change settings**: Give Settings access only to trusted team members so you avoid accidental changes during busy times.
- **Document your choices**: Keep a short internal note on why you chose certain settings, such as refund rules or communication preferences, so new staff can follow the same approach.
