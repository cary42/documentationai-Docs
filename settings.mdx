## What Site Settings control

Site Settings control how Campium behaves for your families, staff, and finance team across modules, payments, the mobile app, and admin behaviors. Campium reads these choices whenever it renders portals, processes payments, or loads the mobile app.

Settings on this screen save automatically as you change them, so updates apply quickly without a single global Save button.

<Callout kind="info">
  Site Settings are shared across your entire account. Before changing anything, confirm how the change will affect families, staff, and existing workflows, especially payment and communication behavior.
</Callout>

## How to open Site Settings

Use the Admin menu to reach the Site Settings screen.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Admin menu" icon="settings">
    From the left sidebar, click **Admin**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to Site Settings" icon="settings">
    In the Admin menu, click **Site Settings**. This opens the main Site Settings screen for your account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm you see the Site Settings tabs" icon="check-circle">
    At the top of the page, you should see a row of tabs such as **Modules**, **Basic**, **Payment Info**, **Mobile App**, and **Admin** (Admin appears only for superusers).
  </Step>
</Steps>

When the page loads, the **Modules** tab appears first. Other tabs load on demand when you click them.

## How saving and validation work

Site Settings use autosave, so you do not click a Save button when you make changes.

- When you change a field (for example, toggle a checkbox, choose from a dropdown, or move out of a text box), Campium saves that change right away.

- If a field requires extra checks, you may see a brief loading indicator or message next to the field.

- If something goes wrong, Campium shows an error near the field instead of saving the new value.

Two settings have extra behavior to be aware of:

- **Contact Email Address**: Campium checks that the email you enter looks valid. If the check fails, the change does not save and you stay on your previous address.

- **Credit Card Surcharge**: Enter the percentage as a number with or without the percent sign. For example, type `3` or `3%` and Campium treats both as the same value.

If you do not see the **Admin** tab, your user account is not a superuser; those settings are restricted.

## Tabs and settings reference

Use the tabs below as a reference to match what you see on the Site Settings screen. Each setting explains what it changes and when to use it.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Modules" icon="settings">
    The **Modules** tab controls which functional areas of Campium are available in your account and, in some cases, in the parent portal and mobile app. All settings here are on/off toggles.

    <Callout kind="tip">
      Turn modules on when you are ready to use them end-to-end. Some modules (for example, payments and messaging) also depend on configuration elsewhere, such as payment processors or communication templates.

      The Admin tab is not part of normal camp admin configuration. If you have questions about subscription status, time zones, training URLs, or similar account-wide items, contact Campium support instead of changing these settings yourself.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Tips for working safely with Site Settings

<Callout kind="tip">
  - **Change one thing at a time**: Because settings auto-save, adjust a single field, confirm the behavior, then move on.

  - **Document sensitive changes**: For payment options and any Admin-level settings, note what changed, when, and why for your internal records.

  - **Use test mode where possible**: For payment processors that support a test environment, validate configuration there before switching to live processing.
