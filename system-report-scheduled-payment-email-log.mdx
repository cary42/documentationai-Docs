## Overview

Use the **Scheduled Payment Email Log** to review all scheduled-payment related emails that Campium Money has sent, including reminders and payment issue notices. Admins rely on this report to confirm that messages were generated, see who received them, and review the exact content that was sent.

Open this report from **Reports > System > Scheduled Payment Email Log**. The page displays results in a table titled **Future Payment Email History**.

<Callout kind="info">

The Scheduled Payment Email Log only shows emails related to scheduled or future payments. Use other communication logs for mass emails, SMS, or unrelated messages.

## Filters

Use the **Filters** panel to narrow the list of emails before reviewing or exporting data. Each filter sits under the **Filters** heading and affects which rows appear in **Future Payment Email History**.

### Email Type

Filter by the category of scheduled payment email. Options:

- **All Types**: Show all scheduled payment emails, regardless of category.
- **No Account**: Show emails sent when a scheduled payment has no valid account on file.
- **Payment Issue**: Show emails about failed or problematic scheduled payments.
- **Reminder**: Show reminder emails for upcoming or scheduled payments.

### Sent By

Limit results by the staff user recorded as the sender. Options include **All Staff** plus individual staff names. Use this to audit which staff member initiated or triggered scheduled payment emails.

### Date From

Start of the date range for the **Date/Time** the email was sent. Leave blank to include all emails up to the **Date To** value.

### Date To

End of the date range for the **Date/Time** the email was sent. Leave blank to include all emails starting at **Date From** through the latest available.

### Search User/Email

Search by user name or email address in the **Recipient** field. Use this to quickly find all scheduled payment emails sent to a specific family or payer.

### Records per page

Control how many rows display at once in **Future Payment Email History**. Options include **50**, **100**, **250**, and **500** emails per page. Higher values reduce the number of pages but may require more scrolling.

### Apply Filters

Run the report with the current filter values. Click this after you adjust any filters to refresh the **Future Payment Email History** table.

### Reset

Clear all filters back to their default values. Use this to return to an unfiltered view of the scheduled payment email log.

If the footer text still shows unexpected totals after changing filters, confirm that you clicked **Apply Filters** and that no search or date filters remain active.

## Future Payment Email History columns

The **Future Payment Email History** table lists one row per scheduled payment email that matches your filters. Use the columns below to understand when the message was sent, who received it, and what it contained.

### Date/Time

Timestamp when the email was sent. This uses your system's date and time format and respects any date range filters you applied.

### Recipient

Name and email address of the person who received the message. This should correspond to the payer or contact tied to the scheduled payment.

### Type

Category of scheduled payment email, such as **No Account**, **Payment Issue**, or **Reminder**, matching the **Email Type** filter values.

### Subject

Email subject line that appeared in the recipient's inbox. Use this to confirm which exact template or message was used.

### Payment Info

Key payment details referenced in the email, such as installment description, due date, or amount. This helps you tie the email back to a specific scheduled or future payment.

### Sent By

Staff user or system identifier recorded as the sender. This aligns with the **Sent By** filter and supports staff-level auditing.

### Message (View)

Action or link to open the full email body. Use this to review the complete text of what the recipient received, including merge fields and payment details.

<Callout kind="info">

When no results match your filters, the table shows the message **No emails found matching the selected filters.** Adjust your filters or clear them with **Reset** to broaden the search.
