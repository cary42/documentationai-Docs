description: Update your camp business details and logo so families see the right name, contact info, and branding across your Campium portals and communications.

## What Business Info & Logo controls

Business Info & Logo settings control the basic details and branding families see when they interact with your camp through Campium.

These details can appear in places like:

- The family portal header or footer
- Automated emails and confirmations
- Printed or exported reports and documents

Keeping this information accurate helps families recognize your camp and know how to contact you.

<Callout kind="info">

Changes to Business Info & Logo may not update every screen or document instantly. If something still looks out of date, refresh your browser and re-check a few minutes later.

</Callout>

## Open Business Info & Logo from the dashboard

Use the main dashboard navigation to reach the Business Info & Logo section.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Site Settings" icon="settings" titleType="p">

    From the dashboard, click **Admin -> Site Settings** in the left sidebar.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Business Info & Logo" titleType="p">

    In Site Settings, look for the **Business Info & Logo** area or tab. This section groups your camp contact details and logo together.

  </Step>
</Steps>

Once you are in the Business Info & Logo section, you can update your contact information and logo as needed.

## Update business and contact information

Use this section to make sure families see the correct camp name and contact details.

Typical fields include:

- Camp or organization name
- Main contact email
- Office phone number
- Mailing or physical address

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review current details" titleType="p">

    Check the **camp name**, **email**, **phone number**, and **address** fields. Make a note of anything that is outdated or incorrect.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit each field" titleType="p">

    Click into a field to edit it, then type the correct information. Use the main camp email and phone number families should use to reach your office.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Check formatting" titleType="p">

    For the address, include street, city, state or province, and postal code on the appropriate lines. For phone numbers, include the area code so families can dial you without confusion.

  </Step>
</Steps>

After updating the text fields, you will save your changes in the section at the bottom of the page (see **Saving changes and common issues**).

## Upload or replace your logo

Your logo helps families recognize your camp in the family portal, emails, and reports.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the logo area" titleType="p">

    In the Business Info & Logo section, find the **Logo** area. You should see your current logo (if you have one) or an empty placeholder.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload a new logo" titleType="p">

    Click **Upload**, **Change logo**, or a similar button. In the file picker that opens, select the image file from your computer and confirm.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Replace an existing logo" titleType="p">

    If a logo is already set, use the same button (for example, **Replace**, **Change**, or **Upload new**) to choose a different image. Confirm the upload, then wait for the new logo preview to appear.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust if needed" titleType="p">

    If the preview looks cut off or stretched, try uploading a different version of your logo with more padding around the edges or closer to a square shape.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">

For the clearest logo:

- Use a **simple version** of your logo without tiny text or complex details.
- Choose an image that works well at **small sizes** (for example, in an email header).
- Prefer a **square or nearly square** image so it fits most layouts cleanly.
- Use a modern image format like **PNG** with a transparent background if available.

If your logo looks fuzzy, try uploading a higher-quality image rather than a screenshot or photo of your logo.

## Verify how your changes look

After you update your business details and logo, confirm what families will see.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the on-screen preview" titleType="p">

    Look for a preview of your logo and contact information directly in the Business Info & Logo section. Confirm that the camp name, email, phone, and address look correct.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the family portal" titleType="p">

    In a new browser tab, open your family portal link. Check the header or footer for the updated camp name and logo, and confirm the logo looks sharp and not cut off.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review outgoing communications or reports" titleType="p">

    If your site uses automated emails or downloaded reports, send a test message or export a sample report. Check that the name and logo appear as expected where branding is shown.

  </Step>
</Steps>

If you do not see the updates, see **Saving changes and common issues** below.

## Saving changes and common issues

Always save your changes and compare what you see on the screen to what families see.

### Save your changes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Save before leaving the page" titleType="p">

    Scroll to the bottom (or top, depending on the layout) of the Business Info & Logo section and click **Save**, **Save changes**, or a similar button. Wait for a confirmation message or check that the button is no longer highlighted.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Refresh other tabs" titleType="p">

    If you had the family portal, email previews, or reports open in another tab, refresh those pages so they load your new settings.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="alert">

If you close your browser tab or navigate away from Site Settings before clicking **Save**, your new business details and logo will not be applied.

</Callout>

### Common issues and how to fix them

#### Logo looks blurry or stretched

- Try uploading a **higher-quality image** of your logo instead of a screenshot.
- Use a logo that is closer to a **square shape** so it does not get stretched.
- Avoid logos with very thin lines or tiny text that disappear at small sizes.

#### Wrong contact email or phone showing

- Return to **Admin -> Site Settings** and open **Business Info & Logo** again.
- Check if you have multiple email or phone fields (for example, a billing email and a main office email).
- Update the field that is actually being used as the main contact and **Save**.
- Refresh the family portal or email preview to confirm the correct contact details appear.

#### Changes are not showing for families

- Confirm you clicked **Save** in the Business Info & Logo section.
- Refresh your browser and sign out then sign back in to the dashboard if needed.
- Open the family portal in a private or incognito window to rule out browser caching.
- If the old information still appears after a short time, contact your internal Campium administrator or support for help reviewing your settings.
