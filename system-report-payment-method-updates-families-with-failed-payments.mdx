## Overview

Use the Payment Method Updates – Families with Failed Payments report to see which families with failed or locked scheduled payments have recently updated their payment method and when they did so.

On the report page, you see this description:

> Shows families who have at least one failed/locked scheduled payment and who recently updated their payment method.

This report helps you confirm that families took action after a failed or locked scheduled payment, so you can decide whether to retry charges or follow up.

<Callout kind="info">

The report only includes families that **both** have at least one failed or locked scheduled payment **and** have recently updated a payment method. Families with failures but no recent update do not appear here.

</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout kind="alert">

If a family does **not** appear in this report but has failed or locked scheduled payments, they have not updated their payment method during the selected date range. Consider contacting them before attempting additional charges.

</Callout>

## Filters

Use the Filters section to control which payment method updates appear in the report.

### Filter fields

All filters appear under the heading **Filters**, above the table.

### Start Date

Lower bound for the date range, based on when the family updated their payment method. The report includes payment method updates **on or after** this date.

### End Date

Upper bound for the date range, based on when the family updated their payment method. The report includes payment method updates **on or before** this date.

### Apply

Runs the report with the selected Start Date and End Date. Click Apply any time you change filter values to refresh the results.

## Report table

The main results appear in a card titled **Payment Method Updates (Families with Failed Scheduled Payments)**.

Each row represents a **single payment method update** by a family that currently has at least one failed or locked scheduled payment.

### Columns

Use the columns to understand what changed and how to follow up.

### Date

Date and time when the family updated their payment method. Use this to confirm whether the update occurred after the failed or locked scheduled payment.

### Name

Family or account holder name associated with the updated payment method. Use this to identify who took action.

### Account

Internal account identifier or label for the family. This helps you match the update back to billing or CRM records.

### Type

Type of payment method that was updated, such as card or bank account. Use this to understand how future scheduled payments will be attempted.

### Link

Action link to open the related record (for example, the family profile or account detail page) where you can review the full payment history and manage scheduled payments.

## Empty state and interpretation

When no matching records are found for the selected filters, the report shows this message:

> No payment method updates found for families with failed/locked scheduled payments in the selected date range.

Use this behavior to interpret your results:

- If you **expect** updates but see this message, expand the date range and click **Apply** again.
- If you are checking follow-up after a recent failed billing run and see this message, families may not have updated payment methods yet and might still need outreach.

## Using the report in your workflow

Use the report alongside your failed or locked scheduled payment views to decide what to do next:

- Confirm that a family appears here **after** they report updating their payment method.
- Check the **Date** column to ensure enough time has passed before retrying charges.
- Use the **Link** column to open the family or account record and reschedule payments or adjust payment plans as needed.
