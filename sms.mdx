## Overview

Use SMS in Campium to send short, one-way text updates to families when you need their attention quickly.

<Callout kind="info">

Campium sends SMS messages from the number `(551) 209-2312`. This is a one-way number; recipients cannot reply to your texts.

</Callout>

## Where to find SMS

Open SMS from the main navigation:

1. Go to **Communication**.
2. Click **SMS**.

The SMS page shows three main areas: **Settings**, **Recipients**, and **Logs**.

## Create and send an SMS

Use this workflow when you want to compose a new text and send it now or schedule it.

<Steps>

<Step title="Open a new SMS" icon="play-circle">

On the **Communication → SMS** page, start a new message if one is not already open, or open an existing draft if you want to edit and send it. Campium shows the three tabs across the top: **Settings**, **Recipients**, and **Logs**.

</Step>

<Step title="Fill in Settings" icon="settings">

Go to the **Settings** tab and complete the fields for your message, timing, and any additional recipients. Campium marks required fields with an asterisk `*`. Keep your SMS text short and clear so families understand the update at a glance.

</Step>

<Step title="Choose your recipients" icon="users">

Switch to the **Recipients** tab to select who should receive the SMS. Use the search and filters to narrow down your audience, then confirm that the list matches who you intend to contact.

</Step>

<Step title="Schedule or send now" icon="zap">

Return to the **Settings** tab to decide when to send. Use **When To Send** for a future time, or leave it blank to send right away. Click **Save SMS** to keep it as a draft, or click **Send Now** to start sending immediately.

</Step>

<Step title="Review delivery in Logs" icon="bar-chart">

After sending, open the **Logs** tab to see when messages were sent and to whom. Use this view to confirm delivery timing and to review your history of SMS communications.

</Step>

</Steps>

### What success looks like

- The SMS appears in **Logs** with a sent time.
- The recipient list in **Recipients** matches your intended audience.
- Families report receiving the text on their phones from `(551) 209-2312`.

## Tabs: Settings, Recipients, Logs

The SMS screen is organized into three tabs. Use each tab for a different part of your workflow.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Settings" icon="settings">

Use **Settings** to write your message, choose timing, and manage extra recipients.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Recipients" icon="users">

Use **Recipients** to control exactly which families and campers receive the SMS.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Logs" icon="bar-chart">

Use **Logs** to review what was sent and when, for record-keeping and follow-up.

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Settings tab

The **Settings** tab controls the content of your SMS and when it goes out.

### SMS Message

Type the text you want families to receive in the **SMS Message** box.

<Callout kind="tip">

Campium shows the note `153 chars = 1 msg. Longer msgs will be split.` Shorter messages are easier to read and may count as fewer message segments for recipients.

</Callout>

Keep your message focused on one topic, such as a schedule change, arrival reminder, or weather update.

### When To Send

Use **When To Send** to schedule the SMS for a specific date and time.

- Enter a date and time to send the SMS later.
- Leave it blank to send the SMS as soon as you click **Send Now**.

Scheduling is helpful for early-morning reminders or evening updates you want to prepare in advance.

### Also send to

Use **Also send to** to add any extra phone numbers that are not already in your camper or parent list.

- Enter phone numbers as a comma-separated list.
- Use this for staff or special contacts who should receive the same message.

Check your extra numbers carefully to avoid sending to the wrong person.

### Also send to campers

Select **Also send to campers (in addition to parents)** if you want campers themselves to receive the SMS as well as their parents.

If you leave this unchecked, Campium sends the SMS only to parents and any numbers you added under **Also send to**.

### Save SMS

Click **Save SMS** to store your current message and settings without sending.

- Use this to create drafts ahead of time.
- Return later to review, update, or send the saved SMS.

Saving before sending is a good way to double-check wording and recipients with your team.

### Send Now

Click **Send Now** when you are ready for the SMS to go out.

- If **When To Send** is blank, Campium begins sending immediately.
- If **When To Send** has a value, Campium queues the SMS to send at that date and time.

<Callout kind="alert">

Before you click **Send Now**, confirm both the **SMS Message** and the **Recipients** list. SMS cannot be unsent once it is delivered.

</Callout>

## Recipients tab

Use the **Recipients** tab to control who receives your message.

On this tab, you generally:

- Search for specific individuals or groups.
- Use filters to narrow the audience to the right families or sessions.
- Review the list to ensure it matches the group you intend to notify.

Aim for the smallest accurate group you need, such as a single session, age group, or bus route, instead of the entire camp, to keep your messages relevant.

<Callout kind="info">

SMS messages from Campium are one-way. Families see them as coming from `(551) 209-2312` and cannot reply, so they will follow up using your usual contact channels.

</Callout>

## Logs tab

The **Logs** tab shows the history of SMS activity.

On this tab, you can typically:

- View when an SMS was sent or scheduled.
- See which recipients were included.
- Confirm that a message you expected to go out appears in the history.

Use Logs when:

- A family asks whether a message was sent about a specific event.
- You want to check the timing of past alerts.
- You are reviewing communications for a particular day or session.

## Best practices for SMS

Thoughtful SMS use helps families stay informed without feeling overwhelmed.

- **Be clear and concise.** Lead with the main point: what is happening, when, and what action (if any) families should take.
- **Use SMS for time-sensitive updates.** Reserve texts for information that families need quickly, such as last-minute changes or urgent reminders.
- **Respect timing.** Avoid very late-night or very early-morning messages unless truly urgent.
- **Avoid over-sending.** If an update is not time-critical, consider email instead, or combine several minor updates into a single SMS.
- **Respect opt-outs and preferences.** If a family asks not to receive texts, keep a note in your records and choose other communication channels for them.
- **Match tone to the situation.** Use a calm, straightforward tone, especially for weather or safety-related updates.

Used well, SMS in Campium helps families feel informed and confident about what is happening at camp.
