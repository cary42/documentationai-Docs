## Overview

Send short, time-sensitive messages to your community as mobile push notifications from the Communications area in Campium.

To open push notifications:

- Go to **Communications** in the main navigation.

- Select **Push Notifications**.

Use this page to understand the workflow, what each tab does, and how to write clear messages that people actually read.

## Create and send a push notification

Use the push notification editor to draft your message, choose who should receive it, and send or schedule delivery.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a new push notification" icon="play-circle" title-type="p">
    - In the left navigation, select **Communications**.

    - Click **Push Notifications**.

    - Choose **New Push Notification** (or the equivalent action your account uses).

    You should now see the push notification editor with tabs for **Settings**, **Recipients**, and **Logs**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill out Settings" icon="edit" title-type="p">
    - Stay on the **Settings** tab.

    - Enter a **Subject**. This field is required and limited to **65 characters max**.

    - Enter a **Message**. This field is optional and limited to **240 characters max**.

    - Choose a **Send Date**. This field is required and controls when the push notification goes out.

    Use **Save** to keep a draft without sending. Use **Send** to queue or send the notification based on the Send Date.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose your recipients" icon="users" title-type="p">
    - Switch to the **Recipients** tab.

    - Use the available options to select who should receive this notification (for example, specific groups, programs, or roles, depending on your setup).

    - Review your selection so the message only goes to people who need it.

    When you are confident in your recipients, return to the **Settings** tab to confirm the subject, message, and Send Date.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and send or schedule" icon="check-circle" title-type="p">
    - On the **Settings** tab, confirm:

      - The **Subject** is clear and within the 65-character limit.

      - The **Message** says what people need to know in 240 characters or less.

      - The **Send Date** is correct (right day and time).

    - If you are not ready to send, click **Save** to keep the notification as a draft.

    - When you are ready, click **Send**.

    After sending, use the **Logs** tab to check the status and history of the notification.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Once you send a push notification, you cannot unsend it. Double-check the subject, message, Send Date, and recipients before you click **Send**.

## Understand the editor tabs

The push notification editor is organized into three tabs. Move between them as needed before you send.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Settings" icon="settings">
    The **Settings** tab is where you write the content of your push notification and decide when it goes out.

    Key fields:

    - **Subject \*** — Required, with **65 characters max**. This is the first line people see in their notification preview, so keep it direct and informative.

    - **Message** — Optional, with **240 characters max**. Use this space to add short details, like times, locations, or next steps.

    - **Send Date \*** — Required. Choose the date and time when the push notification should be delivered.

    Actions:

    - **Save** — Store your current work without sending. Use this if you want another staff member to review the message or if you want to finish it later.

    - **Send** — Send or schedule the notification based on the Send Date. If the Send Date is in the future, the message will be queued until that time. If it is in the past or very near the current time, it may send as soon as possible.

    <Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
      Write the subject first to stay within the 65-character limit. Then use the Message field for any extra detail, up to 240 characters.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Recipients" icon="users">
    Use the **Recipients** tab to decide who should receive the push notification.

    Typical actions:

    - **Select audience groups** — Choose from the audience options available in your account (for example, campers, staff, or other groups configured in your system).

    - **Narrow the list** — Apply filters or criteria, when available, to focus on the people who actually need this information.

    - **Confirm coverage** — Check that you are including everyone who should receive the message, and not including people who do not need it.

    <Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
      If you are unsure which recipient options to use, start with a smaller, clearly defined group and expand later, rather than sending broadly by default.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Logs" icon="bar-chart">
    The **Logs** tab shows the history and status of each push notification, so you can confirm what happened after you clicked Send.

    Typical information available in logs:

    - **Status** — Whether the notification is scheduled, in progress, or finished.

    - **Timing** — When the system attempted to send the notification, based on the Send Date you chose.

    - **Counts or activity** — High-level insight into how many notifications the system attempted to deliver.

    Use Logs to:

    - Confirm that a scheduled notification ran when expected.

    - Check that you did not accidentally send the same message multiple times.

    - Review past notifications before creating a new one on a similar topic.

    <Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
      If you think a notification did not reach your audience, check the **Logs** tab first to see its status and timing before sending a follow-up.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Write effective push notifications

Clear, concise push notifications are more likely to be read and acted on. Use these best practices when drafting your subject and message.

### Subject line tips (65 characters max)

- Lead with the key detail, such as **time**, **location**, or **action** needed.

- Avoid filler words and greetings; space is limited.

- Make it specific enough that people know whether it applies to them.

**Examples of strong subjects:**

- `Bus departure changed to 3:30 pm`

- `Rain plan: afternoon activities moved indoors`

- `Reminder: Parent night check-in at 6:00 pm`

### Message body tips (240 characters max)

- Add only the details needed to act on the message.

- Include one clear call to action (what people should do next).

- Keep sentences short and straightforward.

**Example message:**

`Today’s lake swim is delayed to 3:30 pm due to weather. Counselors, keep groups at cabins until the new time and review safety rules before walking to the dock.`

<Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
  If your subject communicates the main update, use the Message field for the who, where, and what-to-do-next, not for repeating the same sentence.
</Callout>

## Choose the right timing

Timing affects whether people see and can act on your notification.

- **Avoid very late or very early hours** unless it is an urgent safety update.

- **Send reminders with enough lead time** for people to respond or prepare (for example, 1–2 hours before an event).

- **Use the Send Date field** to schedule messages during busy times, such as check-in or pick-up windows.

If you are unsure, ask: *When will this message be most useful for someone receiving it?* Then set the Send Date to match that moment.

## Save drafts and get approvals

For important announcements, you might want another staff member to review the message before sending.

- Click **Save** on the Settings tab to keep the notification as a draft.

- Let your colleague know the draft is ready to review under **Communications → Push Notifications**.

- After review, open the draft, confirm the **Subject**, **Message**, **Send Date**, and **Recipients**, then click **Send**.

Using drafts for higher-stakes messages reduces mistakes and keeps your camp communication consistent.
