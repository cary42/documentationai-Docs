## What portal news is

Portal News lets you post updates that families see in the parent site or portal. Use it to share reminders, forms, documents, and videos in a place parents already check.

You manage portal news from the Communications section of Campium.

## Where to find portal news

Go to **Communications → News For Portal** on the left hand navigation.

You land on a list of your existing news items, with options to add new posts and manage older ones.

## Create and publish a new portal news item

Use these steps to add a new news item that appears in the parent portal.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the news screen" icon="folder" title-type="p">
    - Go to **Communications → News For Portal**.

    - Review the list to make sure you are not duplicating an existing post.

    - Click the option to add **New News**.

    Your screen shows a form with fields like Title, News, News Type, File, Start Date, End Date, and Status.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a clear title" icon="edit" title-type="p">
    - Find the **Title** field.

    - Enter a short, clear label parents will recognize, such as `Bus Schedule for Week 3` or `Medical Forms Due`.

    The title is what parents see first in the portal news list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write the news content" icon="edit" title-type="p">
    - In the **Message** field, enter the full message you want families to read.

    - Use the rich editor tools to format text, add headings, and create bullet lists if needed.

    - Include key details like dates, deadlines, and who to contact with questions.

    What you type here appears when parents open the news item.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a news type" icon="settings" title-type="p">
    - Locate the **News Type** dropdown.

    - Choose **Post News to Portal**, **Post Files to Portal**, or **Video Embed URL&#x20;**&#x62;ased on what you are sharing.

    The type you choose controls how parents interact with the news item in the portal.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add any related file or link" icon="upload" title-type="p">
    - If you selected **Post News to Portal**, use the **File** field to upload or attach the document parents need (for example, medical forms or schedules).

    - If you selected **Video Embed URL**, paste the embed URL into the provided field.

    - If you selected **Post News to Portal**, you usually do not need to attach a file, unless you want to include a downloadable document as part of the post.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set start and end dates" icon="calendar" title-type="p">
    - In **Start Date**, choose the date when the news should begin appearing in the portal.

    - In **End Date**, choose the date when the news should stop showing.

    - Leave the end date blank only if you want the news to remain visible until you manually change it.

    Parents see the item in the portal only between the start and end dates while the status is active.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose the status and save" icon="check-circle" title-type="p">
    - Find the **Status** field.

    - Set the status so the item is active/published according to your site’s labels.

    - Save the news item.

    After you save, check the parent portal to confirm the news appears and looks the way you expect.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
  Saved news items normally appear in the portal shortly after you set an active status and a start date that is today or earlier. If you do not see the item, double-check the dates and status.
</Callout>

## Field reference

Use these notes as a quick guide when filling out portal news.

### Title

Use **Title** to name the announcement in a way that is easy for parents to recognize.

Keep it short but specific so families can scan the portal and know what each item is about.

### News

The **News** field is a rich text editor where you write the main body of your announcement.

Format text, add bullets, and include links so the message is clear and easy to read.

### News Type

**News Type** controls how your item behaves in the portal and what kind of content parents see.

You can choose from three options:

#### Post News To Portal

Use thi&#x73;**&#xA0;**&#x66;or standard text announcements.

Parents click the item and read the content you wrote in the News editor, similar to a bulletin post.

#### Post Files To Portal

Use this when the main purpose of the post is to share a file, such as:

- Registration packets

- Medical or waiver forms

- Daily schedules or packing lists

Parents see the news item in the portal and can open or download the attached file.

#### Video Embed URL

Use this to feature a video directly from the parent portal, such as:

- A welcome message from the director

- A highlight reel from camp

- A how-to walkthrough for parents

When parents open the item, they see and can play the embedded video.

<Callout kind="tip" collapsed="false">
  For YouTube content, get the **share/embed URL** from YouTube and paste **only the URL** into the field. For example, use `https://www.youtube.com/embed/UWlzMIl7E48`.
</Callout>

### File

The **File** field lets you attach a document for families to view or download.

This is most commonly used with **Parent Site Files**, but you can also attach supporting documents to a regular news item if helpful.

### Start Date

**Start Date** is the first day the news item becomes visible in the parent portal.

Set this to the day you want families to start seeing the announcement, even if you create it ahead of time.

### End Date

**End Date** is the last day the news item remains visible.

Use this to automatically remove time-sensitive posts, such as deadlines or event reminders, from the portal after they are no longer relevant.

### Status

**Status** controls whether the news item is active in the portal.

Use it to turn an item on or off without changing its dates, for example if you need to temporarily hide an announcement.

<Callout kind="alert" collapsed="false">
  If a news item is not showing in the parent portal, check three things: **Status** (active), **Start Date** (today or earlier), and **End Date** (not in the past).
</Callout>

## Manage existing portal news

From **Communications → News For Portal**, you can manage the list of existing items.

Each item includes actions that help you keep your portal organized over time. You can access them by clicking on the icon to the left of the news item.

### Copy

Use **Copy** to duplicate an existing news item.

This is helpful when you send recurring reminders or seasonal announcements and only need to update a few details instead of starting from scratch.

### Delete

Use **Delete** to remove a news item you no longer need in your list.

Deleting removes the item from your admin list and prevents it from appearing in the portal going forward.

<Callout kind="alert" collapsed="false">
  Delete items with care if you may need their wording or dates later. If you only want to hide an item from the portal for now, consider archiving it instead of deleting.
</Callout>

### Archive / Unarchive

Use **Archive** to move older or inactive news items out of your main list without permanently deleting them.

Archived items no longer appear to parents in the portal but remain available for your records and can be **Unarchived** if you need to bring them back or reuse their content.

## Tips for clear communication

- Use short, specific titles so families know what is important at a glance.

- Group related information and files in a single news item instead of many separate posts.

- Use dates in the body of the News content as well as Start/End Dates so parents see deadlines clearly.

- Link to forms and documents parents need to complete, and attach files when possible so everything is in one place.
