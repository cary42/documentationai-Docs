## Overview

Use the Scheduled Payments Report to see all upcoming scheduled payments and their expected income so you can follow up with families and manage cash flow.

The report lists each scheduled payment with key contact details, amount, timing, and type, and lets you send targeted payment notifications directly from the results table.

<Callout kind="info">
  You need access to Reports to open and run the Scheduled Payments Report.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Filters and display settings

The Scheduled Payments Report includes one primary filter and a column picker that controls which profile fields appear as table columns.

### Filter by Type

Use the **Filter by Type** dropdown to narrow the list of scheduled payments by payment type.

#### Filter by Type

Choose a specific scheduled payment type, such as tuition installments or fees, to include only matching payments in the results table. When you change this value, the report immediately updates the table below.

<Callout kind="info">
  Changes to **Filter by Type** update the report right away. You do not need to click a separate run or refresh button after adjusting this filter.
</Callout>

### Profile Fields Display Settings

Use Profile Fields Display Settings to choose which profile fields you want to see as additional columns in the results table.

You configure these in the **Profile Fields Display Settings** panel using the **Select Profile Fields to Display** control.

#### Select Profile Fields to Display

Choose one or more profile fields to include as extra columns in the results table. Selected fields appear as columns in the table, with each field name shown as its display name.

<Callout kind="info">
  Filters and profile field selections apply only to this report view. They control which scheduled payments you see and which columns appear; they do not change any underlying profile or payment data.
</Callout>

## Expected Income section

At the top of the report, Campium shows a card labeled **Expected Income** that summarizes upcoming payments.

#### Expected Income

See the total amount of income expected from the scheduled payments currently included by your filters. When you change **Filter by Type**, this total updates to reflect the visible rows in the table. Use this value to understand short-term cash flow based on pending scheduled payments.

## Results table columns

The main table lists one row per scheduled payment. Each row includes a blank Actions column, core contact and payment details, and any extra profile fields you selected.

### Core columns

#### Actions

Use this first column to access row-level actions, such as a button or link to **Send Payment Notification** for that scheduled payment.

#### Name

Shows the primary person or student name associated with the scheduled payment.

#### Phone

Shows the contact phone number pulled from the associated profile, used for follow-up if needed.

#### Guardian 1 Email

Shows the email address for the first guardian or primary contact on the profile tied to this scheduled payment.

#### Guardian 2 Email

Shows the email address for the second guardian or additional contact, if available.

#### Amount

Shows the scheduled payment amount for this row.

#### Season

Shows the season, term, or program label that the scheduled payment belongs to, such as Summer Session or Fall Season.

#### Type

Shows the payment type for this scheduled payment, such as tuition, registration fee, or another configured type. This value matches the options in **Filter by Type**.

#### Message

Shows any note or message associated with the scheduled payment, which may help explain why the payment was created or what it covers.

#### Date

Shows the scheduled date when this payment is expected to process.

### Dynamic profile field columns

In addition to the core columns, the table can show extra columns based on your Profile Fields Display Settings.

#### Dynamic profile field columns

For each profile field you select under **Select Profile Fields to Display**, the table adds a column using that field's display name. Each row shows the value of that profile field for the profile tied to the scheduled payment.

<Callout kind="info">
  Dynamic profile field columns update immediately when you change your selections. If you deselect a field, its column disappears from the table; selecting it again restores the column and values.
