## Overview

Access your account using email and password or, when available, Google and Apple sign-in. Use this guide to sign in, reset your password, and handle common issues confidently.

<Callout kind="info">

You need access to the email address on your account to sign in or reset your password. If you no longer have access to that email, contact your program or school directly.

</Callout>

## Password requirements

New passwords must meet the security rules below. The sign-up, password reset, and change password screens all enforce the same rules.

- At least **12 characters**
- Includes at least **one uppercase letter** (A–Z)
- Includes at least **one lowercase letter** (a–z)
- Includes at least **one special character** (such as `! @ # $ % & *`)

If your new password does not meet these rules, the page shows an error and will not save the password.

### Tips for choosing a strong password

- Combine words and numbers, for example: `BlueRiver!2024`.
- Avoid using your name, your child's name, or your email.
- Use a phrase you can remember, then add numbers and a symbol.

## Sign-in options

You may see one or more of these options on the sign-in page:

- **Email and password** — Enter the email on your account and your password.
- **Sign in with Google** — Use your Google account instead of a separate password.
- **Sign in with Apple** — Use your Apple ID instead of a separate password.

If Google or Apple buttons are not visible, those sign-in methods are not enabled for your account and you should use email and password.

## Sign in with email and password

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the sign-in page" icon="monitor">

  - Open the link provided by your program or school (for example, from an invitation email or their website).
  - Confirm you see the sign-in form with fields for email and password.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter your email address" icon="users">

  - Type the email address that your program or school uses for your account.
  - Double-check for typos, especially dots `.` and plus `+` signs.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter your password" icon="lock">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete sign-in" icon="arrow-right">

  - Select **Sign in**.

</Steps>

If you see an error that your email or password is incorrect, confirm you are using the right email and try again. If you still cannot sign in, reset your password.

## Sign in with Google or Apple

When enabled for your account, the sign-in page shows **Sign in with Google** and/or **Sign in with Apple** buttons.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a provider" icon="cloud">

If you cancel the Google or Apple window or something goes wrong, you may see an error such as `Sign-in was cancelled or failed`. See troubleshooting below for what to do next.

  <Expandable title="I see Sign-in was cancelled or failed" default-open="true">

  The message `Sign-in was cancelled or failed` usually appears when the Google or Apple sign-in window is closed before finishing, or the provider cannot complete the request.

    - If you have multiple accounts, sign out of the others in your browser and try again.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Use email and password instead" icon="terminal">

    - If provider sign-in continues to fail, use the email and password fields on the main sign-in page.
    - If you do not remember your password, follow the reset password steps above.

    </Step>
  </Steps>

  </Expandable>

  <Expandable title="I did not receive the password reset email">

  If you requested a reset email but do not see it, the message may be delayed or filtered by your email provider.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Verify the email address you entered" icon="search">

    - Confirm you typed the correct email on the reset page.
    - Repeat the reset request if you might have entered the wrong address.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Check spam, junk, and filtered folders" icon="inbox">

    - Look in spam, junk, promotions, or other filtered folders.
    - Search for your program or school name if your email client supports it.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Wait a few minutes and try again" icon="clock">

    - Email delivery can sometimes be delayed.
    - If nothing arrives after 10–15 minutes, send another reset request.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Contact your program or school" icon="help-circle">

    - If you still cannot find the email, contact your program or school support.
    - They can confirm which email is on your account and help you regain access.

    </Step>
  </Steps>

  <Expandable title="My new password keeps getting rejected as too weak">

  When your new password is rejected as too weak, it usually does not meet one or more of the required rules.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Check each requirement carefully" icon="list">

    - Confirm your password has at least 12 characters.
    - Check that it includes at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one special character.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Adjust your password" icon="edit">

    - Add another word or number to extend the length.
    - Insert a symbol such as `!`, `@`, `#`, or `$` if none is present.
    - Add a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters if you used only one case.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Try a different phrase" icon="refresh-ccw">

    - If the password still fails, choose a different phrase entirely.
    - Example: `MapleStreet!House27` meets all requirements and is easier to remember than random characters.
