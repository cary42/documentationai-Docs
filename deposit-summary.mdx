title: Deposit Summary report
description: Use the Deposit Summary in Campium to review new and batched deposits, understand fees and net totals, filter by date, create deposits, and export or print.

## Overview

The Deposit Summary report shows two related views of your payments in Campium:

- **New deposits** – individual payments that are ready to be deposited but are not yet in a batch.
- **Deposit summary** – existing deposit batches, each showing a total, estimated fees, and net amount.

Use this report to reconcile check and cash activity, group payments into deposits, and compare what Campium shows to your bank and processor statements.

<Callout kind="info">

The Deposit Summary uses the **date the payment was entered in Campium**, not the date funds moved at the bank or processor.

</Callout>

## Sections in the Deposit Summary

The page contains two main tables:

- **New deposits**  
  Shows recent check, cash, and certain manual payments that **have not been included in any deposit yet**. Use this section when you want to create a new deposit from individual payments.

- **Deposit summary**  
  Shows deposits that have already been grouped and sent through your normal processing. Each row represents a deposit and includes the total amount, estimated fees, and net amount.

<Callout kind="info">

Think of **New deposits** as a staging area for money you still need to group into a deposit, and **Deposit summary** as your history of deposits that can be matched to bank and processor reports.

</Callout>

## Filters and date range behavior

The Deposit Summary includes a simple **Start date** and **End date** filter above the page.

- The **date range applies only to the Deposit summary table** (batched deposits).
- The **New deposits table always shows the current list of payments that are not yet in a deposit**, no matter which dates you choose.

<ParamField query="Start date" param-type="date">

First date in the range used to show batches in the Deposit summary table. By default, this is the first day of the current month.

</ParamField>

<ParamField query="End date" param-type="date">

Last date in the range used to show batches in the Deposit summary table. By default, this is the last day of the current month.

</ParamField>

<Callout kind="alert">

The date filter looks at **when the payment was entered in Campium**. It does not use bank settlement dates or processor cut‑offs. If a payment was entered outside your chosen range, it will not appear in the Deposit summary for that period, even if it settled during those dates.

</Callout>

<Callout kind="info">

The New deposits list is **independent of the date range**. It always reflects the current set of check, cash, and eligible manual payments that have not yet been grouped into a deposit.

</Callout>

## Columns in the New deposits table

The **New deposits** table shows individual payments that can be added to a deposit.

<ParamField body="Select" param-type="boolean" show-location="false">

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="Date Entered" param-type="datetime" show-location="false">

## Columns in the Deposit summary table

The **Deposit summary** table shows one row per deposit batch, along with totals and estimated fees.

<ParamField body="Date" param-type="date" show-location="false">

</ParamField>

<Callout kind="info">

Use the **grand totals** in the footer to reconcile an entire period against your accounting system, bank deposits, or processor statements.

</Callout>

## How fees and net are calculated

Campium estimates fees and net amounts for each deposit based on your agency’s configured processing rates and per‑transaction charges.

At a high level:

- The system uses the percentage rates and per‑payment fees you have set for card and ACH transactions.
- It applies those rates to the payments in the deposit to calculate an **estimated fee amount**.
- The **Net** column is the **Total minus the estimated Fees**.

<Callout kind="info">

Fee amounts in this report are **estimates**. They may not match your processor or bank exactly, especially for chargebacks, refunds, or special pricing. Always rely on your processor statement for final fee totals.

</Callout>

## Run the Deposit Summary report

Use the Financial area in Campium to open and run the Deposit Summary for reconciliation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Deposit Summary" icon="bar-chart">

    - Sign in to your Campium admin account.
    - Go to the **Financial** or **Reports** area.
    - Select **Deposit Summary** from the list of reports.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose your date range for deposits" icon="calendar">

    - Use the **Start date** and **End date** fields to choose the period you want to review.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply and review the results" icon="play-circle">

    - Apply the date range to refresh the **Deposit summary** table.
    - Confirm that deposit totals, estimated fees, and net amounts look reasonable for the selected period.
    - Review the **New deposits** table to see which recent payments are **not yet included** in any deposit.

  </Step>
</Steps>

When the page updates successfully, you see:

- A **New deposits** table with current check, cash, and eligible manual payments that still need to be grouped into deposits.
- A **Deposit summary** table listing deposits whose payments were entered within your chosen date range.

## Create a deposit from new payments

Use the **New deposits** table to group selected payments into a deposit and assign a date that matches when you will deposit or have deposited the funds.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select payments to include" icon="check-circle">

    - In the **New deposits** table, use the checkboxes to select the payments you want to include.
    - Use **Toggle All** in the header to quickly select or clear all listed payments.
    - Check the **Total** at the bottom of the table to confirm it matches what you expect to deposit.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the Create Deposit window" icon="play-circle">

    - Click the **Create Deposit** button in the New deposits footer.
    - A window opens showing a summary of the payments you selected and a field for the deposit date.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the deposit date and save" icon="calendar">

    - Enter the **deposit date** you want associated with the new deposit (for example, the date you will bring the checks or cash to the bank).
    - Choose **Save** or **Submit** to create the deposit.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Understand what happens to the payments" icon="info">

    - Campium groups the selected payments into one or more deposits based on payment type (for example, cash and check).
    - Each payment is now marked as part of a deposit and no longer appears in the **New deposits** table.
    - The deposits will appear in the **Deposit summary** section once they move through your normal processing and receive a batch number.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Return to the Deposit Summary" icon="arrow-right">

    - After saving, you return to the **Deposit Summary** page.
    - The payments you grouped are removed from **New deposits** and will show in deposit views as processing continues.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">

Batch numbers (shown as **Batch Number** in the Deposit summary table) come from downstream Campium and processor workflows, not from the **Create Deposit** action. Use the batch links in the Deposit summary when you need to review the payments inside an existing deposit.

## Export, copy, and print options

Both Deposit Summary tables include export and print buttons so you can share, save, or analyze the data outside of Campium.

Available actions typically include:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Copy" icon="copy">

    Copies the current table view to your clipboard. Use this when you want to paste rows directly into an email, document, or spreadsheet without creating a file.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Excel" icon="download">

    Downloads the table as an Excel‑compatible file. This is helpful if your finance team prefers to use formulas, filters, and formatting in a spreadsheet.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="CSV" icon="download">

    Exports the table as a comma‑separated values file that you can open in Excel, Google Sheets, or import into other accounting tools.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="PDF (landscape legal)" icon="file-text">
