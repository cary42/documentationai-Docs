<Update label="2026-02-26" description="Authentication updates" tags={["security","improvement"]}>
  ## Security

  - Enforced a stronger password policy across registration, password reset, and password change flows.

  - Passwords now require a minimum of 12 characters and must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one special character.

  ## Improvements

  - Added Google and Apple sign-in buttons on the login page to reduce password entry friction for families and staff.
</Update>

<Update label="2026-02-25" description="Portal, reports, and payments" tags={["feature","improvement","bugfix"]}>
  ## Improvements

  - Updated product and session purchase flows to show clearer messaging when no sessions are available.

  - Replaced the loading spinner with a no products available alert when nothing can be purchased.

  ## Reporting

  - Enhanced expense reports with category and vendor dropdown filters, including dynamic filtering as options change.

  ## Bug Fixes

  - Improved credit card payment cancellations by using voiding where appropriate to reduce transaction errors.
</Update>

<Update label="2026-02-24" description="Login security, billing dashboard" tags={["security","feature","improvement","bugfix"]}>
  ## Security and Improvements

  - Restricted logins to the correct agency-specific subdomain and now show an explicit error when a user attempts to sign in from the wrong domain.

  - Increased mobile sign-in reliability by adjusting device fingerprinting logic to avoid IP-related false mismatches.

  ## Billing

  - Added a Scheduled Payments dashboard card with counts, status badges, primary payment details, and family balance context.

  ## Bug Fixes

  - Fixed future-date validation for scheduled communications (announcements and SMS) using timezone-aware date handling.
</Update>
