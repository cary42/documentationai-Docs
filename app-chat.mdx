## Overview

App Chat lets camp staff and admins send quick, direct messages without leaving Campium. Use it to coordinate schedules, follow up with families, or keep staff teams connected.

You open App Chat from **Communication → App Chat** in the main navigation.

<Callout kind="info">

App Chat is designed for short, timely conversations. For announcements that need formatting or larger audiences, use **Mass Emails** instead.

</Callout>

## Find App Chat and understand the layout

When you open **Communication → App Chat**, you see your chat list on the left and the active conversation on the right.

Key areas and labels:

- **Chats**: Your recent 1:1 and group conversations.
- **Favorites**: Chats you have starred for quick access.
- **Groups**: Group conversations organized by teams, cabins, or topics.
- **All Chats**: The full list of conversations you can access.
- **New Chat**: Button to start a new conversation.
- **Start New Chat**: The modal that opens when you create a new chat.
- **Type a message...**: The message box at the bottom of a conversation.
- **Send**: The action to send your message.

## Find an existing chat

Use filters and the chat list to quickly reopen conversations.

<Steps>

<Step title="Open App Chat" icon="message-circle">

From the main menu, go to **Communication → App Chat**. The App Chat screen opens with your recent chats.

</Step>

<Step title="Filter by chat type" icon="filter">

Use the navigation in the chat sidebar to narrow what you see:

- Select **Chats** to see your recent conversations.
- Select **All Chats** to browse everything you have access to.
- Select **Groups** to focus on group conversations only.
- Select **Favorites** to see only chats you have starred.

</Step>

<Step title="Scroll or search your list" icon="search">

Scroll the list to find the conversation you need, then click the chat name to open it. The conversation history appears on the right.

</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">

If you reopen an active conversation, new messages (if any) appear at the bottom of the thread. Scroll up to review earlier history.

</Callout>

## Start a new chat

Use **New Chat** to begin a fresh conversation with one or more people.

<Steps>

<Step title="Click New Chat" icon="plus">

In the App Chat sidebar, select **New Chat**. A **Start New Chat** window opens over the page.

</Step>

<Step title="Search for people" icon="users">

In **Start New Chat**, search for the person or people you want to message. Select them from the list to add them to the chat.

</Step>

<Step title="Create the conversation" icon="check-circle">

After you select your participants, confirm to create the chat. The new conversation opens, ready for your first message.

</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout kind="info">

If you plan to reuse the same set of participants (for example, a cabin team or leadership group), consider keeping that chat in **Favorites** so you can return to it quickly.

</Callout>

## Send a message

Once a conversation is open, send messages using the input at the bottom.

<Steps>

<Step title="Type your message" icon="edit">

Click the message box labeled **Type a message...** at the bottom of the conversation. Enter the message you want to send.

</Step>

<Step title="Review before sending" icon="eye">

Check that you are in the correct chat (look at the chat name at the top) and that your message says what you intend. This is especially important in groups.

</Step>

<Step title="Send the message" icon="send">

Select **Send** to post your message to the conversation. The message appears in the thread with your name and the time.

</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">

For time-sensitive updates, keep messages short and clear, especially in busy group chats. Use follow-up messages instead of one very long message.

</Callout>

## Favorite chats and use groups

Favorites and groups help you keep important conversations easy to reach.

### Star or unstar a favorite chat

Use favorites for chats you open every day, such as leadership or medical teams.

<Steps>

<Step title="Open the chat you want to favorite" icon="message-circle">

From **Chats** or **All Chats**, select the conversation you want to mark as a favorite.

</Step>

<Step title="Star the chat" icon="star">

Use the star or favorite action on the chat (for example, next to the chat name) to mark it. The chat appears under **Favorites** in your sidebar.

</Step>

<Step title="Remove from favorites (optional)" icon="minus">

If a chat is no longer important, use the same star or favorite action again to unstar it. The chat disappears from **Favorites** but stays available under **Chats** or **All Chats**.

</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">

Keep **Favorites** small and focused. Limit it to the chats you truly need to open multiple times a day.

</Callout>

### Work with group chats

Groups keep multi-person conversations together so everyone stays aligned.

<Steps>

<Step title="Locate group conversations" icon="users">

In the sidebar, select **Groups** to see your group chats. Each group represents a shared conversation with multiple participants.

</Step>

<Step title="Open and participate in a group" icon="message-circle">

Select a group name to open it, then use **Type a message...** and **Send** to add your updates or questions. Everyone in the group sees the same conversation history.

</Step>

<Step title="Combine groups with favorites" icon="star">

If you use a group frequently (for example, all counselors for a session), star it so it appears under **Favorites**. This makes it faster to jump back in throughout the day.

</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout kind="alert">

Be careful when messaging in **Groups**. Messages go to everyone in the group, not just one person. Double-check the chat name before you send.

</Callout>

## Best practices for App Chat

Use a few simple habits to keep App Chat organized and helpful for your team.

- Use **Chats** for quick questions and 1:1 follow-ups.
- Use **Groups** for topics where several people need to see the same updates.
- Keep **Favorites** for your most active or time-critical conversations.
- Check App Chat regularly during camp days so you do not miss important updates.
